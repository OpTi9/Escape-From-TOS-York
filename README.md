I've always had a mind full of ideas, which sometimes makes it hard for me to stick to routines or focus on the basics. When I started learning to code, I was so eager to create something fun that I jumped straight into making a game without fully mastering the fundamentals.

"Escape From TOS York" is the game that came out of this journey. It began as an exciting project, but without proper planning or version control, the code became a tangled mess. This experience was a real eye-opener for me. I realized that if you want to get good at coding, there are no shortcuts‚Äîyou need to understand the basics and build from there.

## About the Game üïπÔ∏è

"Escape From TOS York" is a roguelike bullet hell game where you navigate through levels filled with enemies, traps, and bosses. It might not be perfect, but I had a lot of fun making it and learned valuable lessons along the way. The game is packed with inside jokes and memes, making it a humorous experience despite its flaws.

### Feedback

- **Positive**: Viewers enjoyed the humor and twitch memes. The game's initial stages were well-received for their challenge and creativity.
- **Criticism**: Some players felt that while the first half of the game was strong, it lacked variety towards the end and ended abruptly. There were also comments about bugs, balancing issues (it's very hard at the start but becomes too easy later), and unfinished bosses.

I have to admit, after working on it for a month, I became impatient and anxious that I won't finish it. So I decided to set a deadline to wrap the project in a week. This rush led to some of the game's shortcomings, like bugs and unpolished content. Nonetheless, seeing people play and enjoy the game, even with its flaws, was incredibly rewarding.
